Moyer (Father) appeals from the order, entered in the Court\n\nof Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Family Division, denying his ninth\n\nPetition for Special Relief and awarding Alaina J. Leone (Mother) $3,200 in\n\ncounsel fees. Upon review, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n        The trial court summarized the history of this case as follows:\n\n        Th[is matter] commenced on September 27, 2019, when Father\n        filed a Complaint for Primary Custody of the minor child, R.A.L.\n        (DOB: [12/2018]). Approximately one month later, Father\n        submitted a Petition for Interim Custody and for Special\n        Relief in which he alleged, inter alia, that Mother was\n        withholding custody of the minor child in retaliation for\n        initiating his custody action. Mother submitted a [response\n        thereto] in which she alleged, inter alia, that Father had frequent\n        violent, angry outbursts when they lived together and that[,]\n        combined with the child’s medical condition, she did not think\n        Father’s proposed interim custody schedule was appropriate at the\n        time. By two [o]rders [] dated October 25, 2019, th[e c]ourt\n____________________________________________\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n     denied Father’s Petition and granted the portion of Mother’s\n     [r]esponse that requested a one-hour interim relief hearing with\n     a Hearing Officer.\n\n     On October 31, 2019, Mother filed her Counter-Complaint for\n     [Primary Physical and Sole Legal] Custody. Shortly thereafter, on\n     November 7, 2019, Hearing Officer Laura Valles issued her Interim\n     Relief Order of Court—Custody, in which, inter alia, Mother’s\n     status quo of primary physical custody continued[,] with periods\n     of supervised visits for Father on Sundays from 10 a.m. [to] 6\n     p.m.\n\n     Approximately six weeks later, Father submitted a[nother]\n     Petition for Special Relief in which he requested the\n     November 7, 2019 Interim Relief Order [] be vacated as it\n     related to the supervision of his visits, which he alleged was\n     unnecessary, or, in the alternative, required Mother to provide all\n     of the transportation to effectuate the visits. By [o]rder [] dated\n     December 20, 2019, th[e c]ourt denied Father’s Petition and\n     ordered the parties to mutually agree on a halfway point for\n     exchanges.\n\n     A month later, Father submitted his third Petition for\n     Special Relief in which he requested an expedited\n     conciliation with th[e c]ourt after the parties’ mediation\n     had failed to result in an agreement. Father averred that his\n     continued limited custody was prejudicial and that he should not\n     have to wait any longer for relief. By [o]rder [] dated January 24,\n     2020, th[e c]ourt, inter alia, granted Father’s Petition for Special\n     Relief and scheduled the parties for a judicial conciliation to occur\n     on March 11, 2020. [Due to a scheduling conflict for Mother’s\n     counsel, by order dated February 24, 2020, the court rescheduled\n     the judicial conciliation for March 5, 2020.]\n\n     Another month later, Father submitted an Emergency\n     Petition for Special Relief in which he alleged Mother was\n     not following the January 24, 2020 [order] as it related to\n     the parties’ communication. By [order] dated February 24,\n     2020, th[e c]ourt granted Father’s Petition and ordered that all\n     non-emergency communication take place on the Our Family\n     Wizard (“OFW”) application and that Mother was to unblock\n     Father’s phone numbers.\n\n     Following the parties’ judicial conciliation, th[e c]ourt issued an\n     [order] dated March 6, 2020, requiring the parties to participate\n\n\n                                   
  -2-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n     in a full custody evaluation         with   the   [c]ourt-appointed\n     psychological evaluator.\n\n     In April 2020, Mother submitted a Protection from Abuse [(“PFA”)]\n     Petition and Temporary Order against Father, alleging that he had\n     sent her emotionally abusive emails and text messages. The PFA\n     Petition was denied by the Honorable Kathleen R. Mulligan by\n     [order] dated April 7, 2020.\n\n     A few weeks later, Father submitted a fifth Petition for\n     Special Relief. In this Petition, Father averred that he had\n     suspended his visits with the child due to the COVID-19\n     pandemic and the child’s health issues. As a result, Father\n     alleged that he had not seen the child in a month and was\n     requesting video calls take place daily at 6:30 p.m. until\n     such time as Father resumed his physical custody visits.\n     Mother submitted her Response to Father’s Petition for Special\n     Relief in which she averred she had made multiple attempts to\n     facilitate video calls between the child and Father and that Father\n     had failed to respond. At any rate, Mother was agreeable to video\n     calls for Father, but at 6:45 a.m. By two [orders] dated April 27,\n     2020, th[e c]ourt denied Father’s Petition and granted Mother’s\n     Response.\n\n     Almost one month later, Father submitted a Petition for\n     Reconsideration in which he alleged Mother had concocted a\n     forged exhibit included with her previous Response to Father’s\n     Petition for Special Relief regarding video calls. Father also\n     alleged that Mother had engaged in a campaign of alienation\n     against Father. As a result of Mother’s lies and behavior, Father\n     requested the video calls change from 6:45 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and\n     that he be awarded $500 in counsel fees. Mother submitted a\n     Response to Father’s Petition for Reconsideration in which she\n     denied the allegations set forth in his Petition and requested an\n     award of $800 in counsel fees as a result of having to respond to\n     the meritless pleading. By two [orders] dated May 21, 2020, th[e\n     c]ourt denied Father’s Petition and granted the part of Mother’s\n     Response seeking denial of Father’s Petition.\n\n     A few weeks later, Father submitted his sixth Petition for\n     Special Relief and a Petition for Contempt. In the Petition\n     for Special Relief, Father alleged a variety of inappropriate\n     behaviors by Mother, including hacking into his social\n     media account and making derogatory posts, as well as her\n     continued verbal assaults over OFW. Father averred [that]\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n     because of Mother’s behaviors, there was no basis to continue to\n     require his visits to be supervised pending the trial that was\n     scheduled for September 2020. Father also requested $1,000 in\n     counsel fees pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2503(6) for Mother’s\n     dilatory, obdurate, and vexatious behavior. Mother submitted a\n     Response to Father’s Petition for Special Relief in which she denied\n     the allegations set forth in Father’s Petition and alleged that Father\n     concocted the derogatory social media posts as a way to frame\n     Mother. Due to Father’s frivolous Petition, Mother was requesting\n     her own $1,600 in counsel fees, as well as a hearing on the fees\n     requested by Father.\n\n     Father submitted a Reply to Answer for Special Relief and New\n     Matter in which he denied the allegation set forth in Mother’s\n     Response and requested the ability to issue a subpoena to\n     Facebook to prove his point. Mother submitted a Response to\n     Father’s New Matter in which she continued to deny any\n     wrongdoing with Father’s social media and requested Father’s\n     Reply be denied.\n\n     By four [orders] dated June 18, 2020, th[e c]ourt granted in part\n     and denied in part Father’s Petition, including denying his request\n     to eliminate supervision and his request for counsel fees, denied\n     Mother’s Response to the Petition, denied Father’s Reply and New\n     Matter, and granted Mother’s Response to the New Matter.\n\n     In the Petition for Contempt, Father alleged that Mother was in\n     violation of th[e c]ourt’s February 24, 2020 [order] as it related\n     to the usage of OFW for communication between the parties, and\n     he requested a hearing on the matter. Mother did not submit a\n     response to this Petition. By [order] dated June 18, 2020, the\n     issue of contempt was consolidated with the custody trial.\n\n     On July 7, 2020, an administrative [order] was issued dismissing\n     Father’s custody complaint for his failure to pay psychological\n     evaluation fees within the prescribed time period.        Father\n     submitted a Petition for Reinstatement of Custody Complaint,\n     which th[e c]ourt granted by [order] dated July 20, 2020.\n\n     At the same time as Father’s Reinstatement, Mother submitted an\n     Emergency Petition seeking to prevent Father from transporting\n     the child to and from Pittsburgh during his visit, as she did not\n     think sitting in a car seat for four hours total would be good for\n     the child given her spinal condition. Father submitted an Answer\n     to Mother’s Emergency Petition in which he argued there was no\n\n                                     -4-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n        basis to conclude the child riding in the car to and from Pittsburgh\n        would endanger her, as Mother had previously transported the\n        child all over northwestern Pennsylvania. By two [orders] dated\n        July 17, 2020, th[e c]ourt denied Mother’s Petition and granted\n        Father’s Answer.\n\n        Another month later, Father submitted his seventh Petition\n        for Special Relief in which he alleged, inter alia, that Mother\n        had filed a [PFA Petition] in Erie County that was ultimately\n        dismissed after a hearing, and that because no abuse was\n        found to have occurred in that instance, the issue of abuse\n        in Allegheny County was res judicata.[1] Father argued that\n        he should not have to wait for trial to have expanded custody of\n        the child, and requested th[e c]ourt award him with custody every\n        other weekend. Mother submitted a Response to Father’s Petition\n        for Special Relief and denied that the dismissal of her Erie County\n        PFA meant the issue of abuse was resolved. Mother also argued\n        that modifying custody without a hearing would violate the holding\n        set forth in E.B. v. D.B., [209 A.3d 451 (Pa. Super. 2019),2] and\n        she requested $1,600 in counsel fees for having to respond to\n        Father’s Petition. By two [orders] dated August 24, 2020, th[e\n        c]ourt denied all of Father’s Petition except for the request to\n        address any sanctions against Mother at the upcoming trial[,] and\n        denied Mother’s Response.\n\n        Around this same time, Mother presented a Motion for\n        Continuance of the upcoming trial. Mother alleged that because\n        Father had failed to timely pay the psychological evaluation fees,\n        the evaluations had not yet been completed[,] and, therefore, the\n        evaluator’s report would not be available for trial.       Father\n____________________________________________\n1 Res judicata “bars the re[-]litigation of issues that either were raised or could\n\nhave been raised in [a] prior proceeding.” Khalil v. Cole, 240 A.3d 996, 1004\n(Pa. Super. 2020). “[T]he doctrine of res judicata holds that a final[,] valid\njudgment upon the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction bars any future\nsuit between the same parties or their privies on the same cause of action.”\nDempsey v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 653 A.2d 679, 680-81 (Pa. Super 1995)\n(en banc).\n\n2 See E.B. v. D.B., supra at 446 (trial court abused discretion by altering\nstatus quo without notice and opportunity to be heard after full preparation,\nwithout any apparent emergency or change in circumstances, without\nexplanation as to why it was in child’s best interest, and without considering\neffect of eliminating years of detailed prior orders in exchange for order not\nspecifically tailored to parties’ and child’s needs).\n\n                                               -5-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n     submitted an Answer to Motion for Continuance in which he\n     argued that th[e c]ourt did not need psychological evaluations to\n     make a custody determination, and that because Father had been\n     waiting a year for trial[,] that th[e c]ourt absolutely could not\n     delay the matter any further, as Father’s due process rights have\n     already been infringed upon with the delay caused by the COVID-\n     19 pandemic. In the alternative, Father proposed that Mother pay\n     the fees, and that th[e c]ourt hold one day of trial and take\n     testimony from the parties and issue an interim order while\n     psychological evaluations take place thereafter. Mother submitted\n     a Response to Father’s Answer in which she argued the\n     importance of psychological evaluations in this case and pointed\n     out that any delay [] has been entirely the fault of Father. By two\n     [orders] dated August 28, 2020, th[e c]ourt granted Mother’s\n     Motion for Continuance and denied Father’s Response. [Father\n     paid his psychological evaluation fee the same day, and Mother\n     paid her fee on October 2, 2020.]\n\n     Approximately two weeks later, Father submitted his\n     eighth Petition for Special Relief seeking to change his\n     custody supervisor from his sister to his cousin. Mother\n     submitted a Response to Father’s Petition for Special Relief in\n     which she explained that she denied Father’s request to change\n     the supervisor because she did not know his cousin and did not\n     feel comfortable that his cousin could attend to the child’s needs.\n     By two [orders] dated September 10, 2020, th[e c]ourt granted\n     Father’s Petition and denied Mother’s Response.\n\n     About one month later, Father submitted his ninth Petition\n     for Special Relief that raised several tangential issues\n     related to Mother’s behavior and his continued belief that\n     supervised custody was unnecessary, which justified another\n     request to modify custody pending the trial because he simply had\n     waited long enough. In her Response to Father’s Petition for\n     Special Relief, Mother explained that the trial being delayed from\n     September 2020 to sometime in February 2021 was the direct\n     result of Father’s refusal to pay the psychological evaluation fee,\n     and that this latest pleading was his fifth request to modify\n     custody in motions court. Mother argued that Father’s Petition\n     was repetitive, baseless, obdurate, and vexatious, and, as a\n     result, requested $1,600 in counsel fees. By two [orders] dated\n     October 16, 2020, th[e c]ourt denied Father’s Petition and granted\n     Mother’s Response.\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n        Shortly thereafter, Father submitted a Motion for Reconsideration\n        in which he argued that he should not be required to pay Mother\n        $1,600 in counsel fees because his main reason for his previous\n        Petition for Special Relief was due to Mother’s repeated violations\n        of the outstanding [orders]. Father went on to argue that th[e\n        c]ourt lacked authorization under 42 Pa.C.S.A. §2503(7) to award\n        counsel fees absent a finding of dilatory, obdurate, or vexatious\n        conduct. Father also argued th[e c]ourt lacked justification under\n        23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5339 because nearly all of his previous petitions\n        were about Mother’s behavior and her violations of various court\n        orders. Father requested the issue of counsel fees be consolidated\n        with trial.\n\n        Mother submitted a Response to Father’s Motion for\n        Reconsideration in which she argued that[,] despite Father’s\n        assertions that his petitions were about Mother’s violation of the\n        court orders, a review of the docket showed redundant Petitions\n        for Special Relief, as opposed to Petitions for Contempt, which\n        would have been the proper pleading. By continuously submitting\n        inappropriate and rejected Petitions for Special Relief that made\n        vague and unsupported allegations against her[,] and which\n        requested modifications of the current order of court, Mother\n        argued that Father caused her financial harm by forcing her to\n        defend herself every few weeks from improper pleadings. As a\n        result, Mother requested another $1,600 in counsel fees. By two\n        [orders] dated November 3, 2020, th[e c]ourt denied Father’s\n        Motion and granted in part and denied in part Mother’s Response.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 2/16/21, at 1-11 (emphasis added).3\n\n        Father timely filed a notice of appeal and court-ordered Pa.R.A.P.\n\n1925(b) concise statement of errors complained of on appeal. He raises the\n\nfollowing issue for our review:\n\n        Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt committed an abuse of discretion in\n        awarding counsel fees to Mother without identifying the reason for\n        the award of counsel fees; without making any findings as to the\n        reason for the [] counsel fees awarded; without making any\n____________________________________________\n3 On February 12, 2021, “after conciliation at which both parties were\nrepresented by counsel,” the court ordered that Father’s custodial periods\nshall continue as previously ordered with the modification that they be\nunsupervised. See Order, 2/12/21.\n\n                     
                          -7-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n        findings regarding sanctionable conduct; and without any\n        determination of Father’s ability to pay the awarded counsel fees.\n\nBrief of Appellant, at 4.\n\n        Father argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding\n\nMother counsel fees. “Our standard of review of an award of counsel fees is\n\nwell-settled: we will not disturb a trial court’s determination absent an abuse\n\nof discretion. A trial court has abused its discretion if it failed to follow proper\n\nlegal principles or misapplied the law.” Dong Yuan Chen v. Saidi, 100 A.3d\n\n587, 591 (Pa. Super. 2014) (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Here, the trial court relied on section 5339 of the Child Custody Act 4 and\n\nsection 2503 of the Judicial Code5 in awarding Mother counsel fees. See Trial\n\nCourt Opinion, 2/16/21, at 13. Section 2503 entitles a litigant to reasonable\n\ncounsel fees where the conduct of another party was dilatory, obdurate,\n\nvexatious, arbitrary, or in bad faith. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2503(7), (9). “The\n\ndistinction between section 5339 of the Domestic Relations Code and section\n\n2503 of the Judicial Code is simply the addition of the word ‘repetitive.’” Dong\n\nYuan Chen, supra at 591; see also 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5339 (court may award\n\ncounsel fees to party if court finds conduct of another party was obdurate,\n\nvexatious, repetitive, or in bad faith) (emphasis added).6 We are mindful\n\nthat:\n____________________________________________\n4 See 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5339.\n\n\n5 See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2503.\n\n\n6 We have previously adopted the following definitions in this context:\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n        By imposing [] strict definitional guidelines, [section 2503] serves\n        not to punish all those who initiate legal actions which are not\n        ultimately successful or which may seek to develop novel theories\n        in the law. Such a rule would have an unnecessarily chilling effect\n        on the right to bring suit for real legal harms suffered. Rather,\n        [section 2503] focuses attention on the conduct of the party from\n        whom attorney’s fees are sought and on the relative merits of\n        that party’s claims.\n\nThunberg v. Strause, 682 A.2d 295, 300 (Pa. 1996) (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, “the best interest of a child is the foundation of the child custody\n\nlaw, and that includes section 5339. . . . [G]reat emphasis must be placed\n\non the best interest of the child based on a consideration of all factors that\n\nlegitimately affect the child’s physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual well-\n\nbeing.” Dong Yuan Chen, supra at 592.\n\n        Here, the trial court specifically found that Father’s conduct was\n\n“repetitive, vexatious, and in bad faith.” Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/21, at 14.\n\nHowever, because the trial court has not articulated specific facts as to why\n____________________________________________\n\n    \uf0b7   “Arbitrary”- based on random or convenient selection or choice rather\n        than on reason or nature.\n\n    \uf0b7   “Vexatious”- without sufficient grounds in either law or fact and for the\n        sole purpose of causing annoyance.\n\n    \uf0b7   “In bad faith”- for purposes of fraud, dishonesty, or corruption.\n\n    \uf0b7   “Obdurate”- stubbornly persistent in wrongdoing.\n\n    \uf0b7   “Dilatory”- lack of diligence that delays proceedings unnecessarily and\n        causes additional legal work.\n\n    \uf0b7   “Repetitive”- repeated many times in a way that is unpleasant.\n\nSee In re Estate of Burger, 852 A.2d 385, 391 (Pa. Super. 2004); Dong\nYuan Chen, supra at 591.\n\n                                               -9-\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n\nFather’s petitions were repetitive, vexatious, or in bad faith, and our\n\nindependent review indicates that the trial court granted the majority of\n\nFather’s requested remedies, we are constrained to vacate the award of\n\ncounsel fees to Mother and remand for a hearing to ascertain whether Father’s\n\nconduct was, as a matter of law, repetitive, vexatious, or in bad faith, and, if\n\nso, determine a reasonable award of counsel fees to Mother.\n\n        This Court first addressed an award of counsel fees for “repetitive”\n\nbehavior in Dong Yuan Chen v. Saidi, supra. In that case, the trial court\n\nrelied on section 5339 to award counsel fees to Wife based on Husband’s filing\n\nof “repetitive” petitions to modify custody; Husband filed seven petitions to\n\nmodify custody in a seven-year span, and the trial court granted only his\n\nfourth petition in part.7 In reversing the award of counsel fees, this Court\n\n\n____________________________________________\n7 In Dong Yuan Chen, supra, we stated:\n\n\n\n        The various petitions, filed typically at least one year apart from\n        each other, involved a range of issues. The first petition for\n        modification was filed on February 7, 2007, seeking primary\n        custody. The second petition was filed on February 19, 2008,\n        seeking a modification of the school-holiday and summer-break\n        schedule. In the third petition, filed on May 26, 2009, Father\n        sought to amend the school-year custody schedule, seeking\n        custody every other Friday night. In his fourth petition, filed on\n        April 26, 2010, Father requested an increase in the summer\n        shared custody schedule, from two weeks of summer vacation\n        time to four weeks. The fifth petition was filed on April 5, 2011,\n        seeking modification of the school-year schedule. The sixth\n        petition was filed on December 5, 2011, seeking to travel\n        internationally with the child. Lastly, the seventh petition was\n        filed on July 5, 2012, and in that petition, Father sought, again, to\n        modify the school-year schedule. . . . Father’s second petition\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n\ndetermined that Husband’s behavior did not rise to the level of “repetitive”\n\nwithin the meaning of section 5339. We reasoned as follows:\n\n        Given the fact that Husband filed the seven petitions over as many\n        years, and in light of the fact that each petition sought distinct\n        relief pertaining to a variety of legitimate issues that\n        typically arise in a custody matter, we cannot conclude that\n        Husband's actions rose to the level of “repetitive” within the\n        meaning of section 5339. Furthermore, we cannot say that\n        each of the petitions was without relative merit.\n        Additionally, there is no indication that any of these petitions\n        affected the child’s best interests. We conclude, therefore,\n        that the court’s award of attorneys’ fees under section 5339 was\n        unwarranted and an abuse of discretion in this case.\n\nId. at 593 (emphasis added).\n\n        Here, although Father filed petitions for special relief more frequently\n\nthan in Dong Yuan Chen, like that case, each petition sought distinct relief\n\npertaining to a variety of legitimate issues.8 Moreover, where the trial court\n\n____________________________________________\n\n        was resolved by an agreed order[,] . . . and his fourth petition,\n        filed April 26, 2010, was granted in part.\n\nId. at 592-93.\n\n8 In his first Petition, filed October 2019, Father sought an interim custody\norder because Mother was allegedly withholding custody of the minor child\nfrom him in retaliation for filing a custody complaint. See Petition, 10/24/19.\nIn his second Petition, filed December 2019, Father requested the trial court\nvacate its November 7, 2019 order requiring supervised visits with the child,\nbecause he spent two of his eight hours per week with the child traveling to\nand from pick-up and drop-off points that Mother changed unilaterally and\narbitrarily. See Petition, 12/13/19. While the Petition was denied, it was\neffectively granted to the extent that the parties were ordered to mutually\nagree on a halfway point for exchanges. See Order, 12/20/19. In his third\nPetition, filed January 2020, which the trial court granted, Father sought an\nexpedited conciliation with the court following an unsuccessful mediation\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\ngranted three of the nine Petitions outright (the third, fourth, and eighth\n\npetitions), granted one petition in part (the sixth petition), effectively granted\n\ntwo additional petitions in part (the second and fifth petitions),9 and ultimately\n\napproved Father’s request for unsupervised custodial periods,10 see Order,\n\n____________________________________________\n\nattempt with Mother, and further requested the parties be required to\ncommunicate solely through OFW due to ongoing communication issues\nbetween them. See Petition, 1/17/20. In his fourth Petition, filed February\n2020, which the trial court granted, Father requested that Mother unblock\nhis phone number and use OFW for non-emergency contact only, following an\nincident where the child was hospitalized but Father could not contact Mother\nvia phone. See Petition, 2/26/20. In his fifth Petition, filed April 2020, Father\nrequested daily video calls with the minor child after suspending visits with\nher due to her health issues and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; although\nthe court denied his petition, the court effectively granted Father’s request\nto have daily video calls with the child, albeit at the time Mother chose. See\nOrder, 4/27/20. In his sixth Petition, which the trial court granted in part,\nFather sought, inter alia, limited discovery into Facebook and cell phone\nrecords to determine whether Mother was using his social media accounts,\nrequested that Mother not communicate with Father’s girlfriend, and\nrequested that supervised visits be able to occur in Pittsburgh, where Father\nlives. See Order, 6/18/20. In his seventh Petition, filed after Mother\nunsuccessfully sought a PFA against him in Erie County, Father requested that\nthe court vacate its order requiring supervised custody and find the issue of\ndomestic abuse res judicata. See Petition, 8/3/20. In his eighth Petition,\nwhich the trial court granted, Father requested the trial court order that, in\nthe event Father’s sister could not supervise his visits with the minor child,\nFather’s cousin, a father of two minor children himself, may supervise the\nvisits, after Mother refused Father’s request for the same. See Petition,\n9/3/20. In his ninth Petition, Father requested the court order that Mother\nrefrain from contacting Father’s girlfriend and cooperate with Father at pick-\nups and drop-offs, in accordance with its prior orders, and again requested\nthat the court vacate its order requiring supervised visits. See Petition,\n10/16/20.\n\n9 See supra, at n.8.\n\n\n10In awarding counsel fees for Father’s “repetitive” filings, the trial court\nemphasized that “an underlying theme throughout was his belief that\n\n\n              
                                 - 12 -\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n2/12/21, “we cannot say that each petition is without relative merit.” See\n\nid.; see also Thunberg, supra at 300. Additionally, we note that here, as\n\nin Dong Yuan Chen, “the trial court failed to explain in its opinion how the\n\nfiling of [Father’s nine petitions in twelve months] legitimately affected the\n\nwell-being of the child or how the filings in any way altered the status quo.”\n\nSee id. at 592.11\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\nsupervised visits were unnecessary.” Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/21, at 14.\nHowever, the trial court evidently agreed with Father’s assessment before\nissuing its Rule 1925 opinion. See Order, 2/12/21 (removing requirement\nthat Father’s custodial time be supervised).\n\n11 Meanwhile, Father specifically argued in his ninth petition, inter alia, that:\n\n\n\n        [N]early one year ago, Mother [] made claims regarding Father’s\n        abusive behavior. As a result, Father’s time [with Child became]\n        supervised. However, the court made no findings that abuse\n        occurred nor articulated why Father’s time was supervised.\n\n        Mother also filed a failed PFA in Erie County, which Mother lost on\n        the merits. . . . The issue of alleged abuse was litigated . . . and\n        the Judge found Mother not to be credible.\n\n        Since the beginning of this litigation, Mother has done everything\n        in her power to interfere [with] Father’s custodial time and\n        relationship with the child including refusing to agree to anything\n        (i.e.[,] another supervisor, providing her telephone number,\n        meeting location change, and allowing Father to take the child,\n        supervised, to family gatherings to name just a few). . . . [I]t is\n        in the child’s best interest to have a normal relationship\n        with both parents . . . [and] with her sibling. Father is\n        requesting [the court] provide his child with the opportunity to not\n        only have a normal relationship with him, but with her sibling.\n\nPetition, 10/16/20, at 5 (paragraphs reordered for clarity; unnecessary\ncapitalization omitted).\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award of counsel fees\n\nunder section 5339 for “repetitive” filings was “unwarranted and an abuse of\n\ndiscretion in this case.” See Dong Yuan Chen, supra at 593. We next turn\n\nto whether the court abused its discretion in awarding counsel fees under\n\nsection 2503 for behavior that was “vexatious[] and in bad faith” without a\n\nhearing. See Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/21, at 14; Brief of Appellant, at 13.\n\n      Here, the trial court found that counsel fees were warranted under 23\n\nPa.C.S.A. § 2503, which provides that counsel fees may be awarded when the\n\nconduct of another participant is vexatious or in bad faith.       See id. at §§\n\n2503(7), (9). This Court explained in In re Estate of Burger, 852 A.2d 385\n\n(Pa. Super. 2004), that:\n\n      An opponent also can be deemed to have brought suit\n      “vexatiously” if he filed the suit without sufficient grounds in either\n      law or in fact and if the suit served the sole purpose of causing\n      annoyance. Finally, an opponent can be charged with filing a\n      lawsuit in “bad faith” if he filed the suit for purposes of fraud,\n      dishonesty, or corruption.\n\nId. at 391 (emphasis added). “[D]isposition of claims under either section\n\ngenerally requires an evidentiary hearing[. However,] no hearing is necessary\n\nwhere the facts are undisputed.” Id. We have further held that, where the\n\nrecord is unclear as to whether the appellant brought the instant action\n\nvexatiously or in bad faith, “the trial court err[s] in awarding attorney’s fees\n\nand costs in the absence of a hearing to determine whether [the] appellant\n\n[actually] acted [] vexatiously[] or in bad faith.” State Farm Mut. Auto.\n\nIns. Co. v. Allen, 544 A.2d 491, 494 (Pa. Super. 1988).\n\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\n        As a preliminary matter, we note that the trial court did not articulate\n\nspecific facts as to how Father acted vexatiously; the trial court did not\n\nconclude that Father filed his complaint for primary custody or any petition for\n\nspecial relief without sufficient grounds in fact or in law. Additionally, we are\n\nconstrained to disagree that Father’s filing served the “sole purpose of causing\n\nannoyance” where the trial court granted much of Father’s requested relief.\n\nSee In re Estate of Burger, supra at 391; see also supra at n.8. Although\n\nFather may have intended to frustrate Mother, our independent review of the\n\nrecord indicates that Father’s filings demonstrate a legitimate desire to spend\n\nmore time and foster a “normal relationship” with his minor child as early as\n\npossible. See, e.g., Petition, 10/24/19; Petition, 12/13/19; Petition, 2/26/20;\n\nPetition, 9/3/20; Petition, 10/16/20. See also Thunberg v. Strause, supra\n\nat 300 (“strict definitional guidelines” under section 2503 necessary to prevent\n\nchilling effect on right to bring suit for harms suffered).\n\n        Furthermore, the trial court has not articulated “undisputed facts”12\n\nestablishing Father’s bad faith—i.e., that Father acted “for purposes of fraud,\n\n____________________________________________\n12 See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Allen, supra (reversing award of\n\ncounsel fees under section 2503 for vexatious conduct in bad faith where facts\nsupporting award were not undisputed; trial court awarded fees based on\n“flagrant lies” and “deliberate omissions of material fact” in appellant’s filings,\nbut “in the absence of a hearing to further develop the record on the question\nof appellant’s bad faith, [this Court] cannot determine the propriety of the\naward of attorney’s fees and costs”); In re Estate of Burger, supra at 390-\n92 (undisputed facts established appellee did not act in bad faith by filing\napplication to quash appeal as untimely where docket erroneously indicated\nappeal was not timely filed, because appellee was entitled to rely on contents\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\x0cJ-S15006-21\n\n\ndishonesty, or corruption.” See In re Estate of Burger, supra at 391. The\n\ntrial court concluded Father acted in bad faith by arguing that Mother’s motion\n\nto continue the custody trial caused him prejudicial delay “while ignoring the\n\nfact that trial had been delayed in large part by his own refusal to pay the\n\npsychological evaluation fee,”13 specifically reasoning that “arguments of\n\nprejudicial delay are disingenuous when the party making them has done\n\nnothing but obstruct[] the process.”               Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/21, at 15.\n\nAgain, however, we are constrained to disagree upon our review of the record\n\nthat Father “has done nothing but obstruct[] the process” where the trial court\n\ngranted the majority of his remedies sought, see supra at n.8, and agreed\n\nwith Father prior to issuing its Rule 1925 opinion that supervised custody was\n\nunnecessary, as Father has consistently maintained throughout his petitions.\n\nSee Thunberg v. Strause, supra at 300 (section 2503 focuses on conduct\n\nof party from whom attorney’s fees are sought and on relative merits of that\n\nparty’s claims).\n\n        Lastly, the trial court concluded that Father acted in bad faith by filing\n\nPetitions for Special Relief, rather than Petitions for Contempt, to enforce\n\nMother’s compliance with prior orders of court. Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/21,\n\n____________________________________________\n\nof court’s official docket); Kulp v. Hrivnak, 765 A.2d 796, 800 (Pa. Super.\n2000) (undisputed facts established appellant acted in bad faith by willfully\nviolating terms of settlement agreement).\n\n13 The record demonstrates that Father paid the court-ordered psychological\n\nevaluation fees on August 28, 2020.                     See Petition, 10/16/20, Exhibit A\n(schedule of payments).\n\n

Nevertheless, in addition to the fact that Father did file a Petition\n\nfor Contempt in June of 2020, Pa.R.C.P. 1915.13 provides that, “at any time\n\nafter commencement of [an] action,” the court, on its own motion or upon\n\napplication, may “grant appropriate interim or special relief[ which] may\n\ninclude . . . the award of temporary legal or physical custody . . . and a\n\ndirection that a person . . . comply with any order of the court.” 231 Pa. Code.\n\n§ 1915.13.\n\n      Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in awarding Mother counsel fees under section 2503 for conduct\n\nthat was “vexatious[] and in bad faith,” see Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/21, at\n\n16, absent a hearing to develop on the record the question of Father’s\n\nvexatiousness or bad faith. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Allen, supra\n\nat 326; Dong Yuan Chen, supra at 591; see also supra, at n.12.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we reverse the trial court’s award of counsel\n\nfees to Mother and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nOpinion. On remand, the trial court shall hold a hearing to develop the record\n\non the issue of whether Father’s conduct, in light of the relative merits of his\n\nclaims, was repetitive, vexatious, or in bad faith as a matter of law, and, if so,\n\ndetermine a reasonable award of counsel fees to Mother.\n\n      Order reversed.

Madison summary', 'backend': 'web', 'source': 'https://www.britannica.com/event/Marbury-v-Madison', 'title': 'Marbury v. Madison | Background, Summary, & Significance', 'content': 'Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nMarbury v. Madison (1803) is a legal case in which the U.S. Supreme Court asserted for itself and the lower courts created by Congress the power of judicial review , by means of which legislation, as well as executive and administrative actions, deemed inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution could be declared unconstitutional and therefore null and void. State courts eventually assumed a parallel power with respect to state constitutions .\n\nMarbury v. Madison arose after the administration of U.S. Pres. Thomas Jefferson withheld from William Marbury a judgeship commission that had been formalized in the last days of the preceding John Adams administration but not delivered before Jefferson’s inauguration . Ruling on a request by Marbury, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it could not order the surrender of the commission because the law that would have empowered it to do so was unconstitutional.\n\nMarbury v. Madison is important because it established the power of judicial review for the U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal courts with respect to the Constitution and eventually for parallel state courts with respect to state constitutions . The exercise of judicial review would help to ensure that the judiciary remained a coequal branch of government alongside the legislative and executive branches.\n\nMarbury v. Madison ,  legal case in which, on February 24, 1803, the U.S. Supreme Court first declared an act of Congress unconstitutional, thus establishing the doctrine of judicial review . The Court’s opinion, written by Chief Justice John Marshall , is considered one of the foundations of U.S. constitutional law .\n\nIn the weeks before Thomas Jefferson ’s inauguration as president in March 1801, the U.S. Congress , still controlled by the lame-duck Federalist Party , created 16 new circuit judgeships (in the Judiciary Act of 1801 ) and an unspecified number of new judgeships (in the Organic Act), which President John Adams proceeded to fill with Federalists in an effort to preserve his party’s control of the judiciary and to frustrate the legislative agenda of Jefferson and his Republican ( Democratic-Republican ) Party. Because he was among the last of those appointments (the so-called “midnight appointments”), William Marbury , a Federalist Party leader from Maryland, did not receive his commission before Jefferson became president. Once in office, Jefferson directed his secretary of state, James Madison , to withhold the commission, and Marbury then petitioned the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus (an order requiring the performance of a specific act) to force Madison to reinstate Marbury’s commission.\n\nMarbury and his lawyer, former attorney general Charles Lee, argued that signing and sealing the commission completed the transaction and that delivery, in any event, constituted a mere formality. But formality or not, without the actual piece of parchment, Marbury could not enter into the duties of office. Despite Jefferson’s hostility, the Court agreed to hear the case, Marbury v. Madison , in its February 1803 term.\n\nSome scholars have questioned whether Marshall should have removed himself from the case because of his prior service as Adams’s secretary of state (1800–01). Certainly, later judicial standards would have called for recusal, but at the time only financial connections to a case led judges to step aside, as Marshall did in suits regarding Virginia lands in which he had an interest. The Republicans, always quick to criticize Marshall, did not even raise the issue of the propriety of his sitting in the case.\n\nThe issue directly presented by Marbury v. Madison can only be described as minor. By the time the Court heard the case, the wisdom of Jefferson’s desire to reduce the number of circuit justices had been confirmed (and the Judiciary Act of 1801 had been repealed); Marbury’s original term was almost half over; and most people, Federalists and Republicans alike, considered the case to be moot. But Marshall, despite the political difficulties involved, recognized that he had a perfect case with which to expound a basic principle, judicial review, which would secure the judiciary’s role in constitutional interpretation.\n\nThe chief justice recognized the dilemma posed by the case . If the Court issued the writ of mandamus, Jefferson could simply ignore it, because the Court had no power to enforce it. If, on the other hand, the Court refused to issue the writ, it would appear that the judicial branch of government had backed down before the executive branch, and that Marshall would not allow. The solution he chose has properly been termed a tour de force. In one stroke, Marshall managed to establish the power of the Court as the ultimate arbiter of the U.S. Constitution , to chastise the Jefferson administration for its failure to obey the law, and to avoid having the Court’s authority challenged by the administration.\n\nMarshall, adopting a style that would mark all his major opinions, reduced the case to a few basic issues. He asked three questions:\n\nThe last question, the crucial one, dealt with the jurisdiction of the Court, and in normal circumstances it would have been answered first, since a negative response would have obviated the need to decide the other issues. But that would have denied Marshall the opportunity to criticize Jefferson for what the chief justice saw as the president’s flouting of the law.\n\nFollowing the arguments of Marbury’s counsel on the first two questions, Marshall held that the validity of a commission existed once a president signed it and transmitted it to the secretary of state to affix the seal. Presidential discretion ended there, for the political decision had been made, and the secretary of state had only a ministerial task to perform—delivering the commission. In that, the law bound him, like anyone else, to obey. Marshall drew a careful and lengthy distinction between the political acts of the president and the secretary, in which the courts had no business interfering, and the simple administrative execution that, governed by law, the judiciary could review.\n\nHaving decided that Marbury had the right to the commission, Marshall next turned to the question of remedy, and once again found in the plaintiff’s favor, holding that\n\nhaving this legal title to the office, [Marbury] has a consequent right to the commission, a refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of that right, for which the laws of his country afford him a remedy.\n\nAfter castigating Jefferson and Madison for “sport[ing] away the vested rights of others,” Marshall addressed the crucial third question. Although he could have held that the proper remedy was a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court—because the law that had granted courts the power of mandamus in original (rather than appellate) jurisdiction, the Judiciary Act of 1789 , was still in effect—he instead declared that the Court had no power to issue such a writ, because the relevant provision of the act was unconstitutional. Section 13 of the act, he argued, was inconsistent with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which states in part that “the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction” in “all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party,” and that “in all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction.” In thus surrendering the power derived from the 1789 statute (and giving Jefferson a technical victory in the case), Marshall gained for the Supreme Court and lower courts a far-more-significant power, that of judicial review.'''}]]
